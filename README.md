Frogger Clone
===============================

Steps: 
  - Build game from index.html

How-to-Play:
  Using the arrow keys, move the player from the grass to the water, while avoiding the bugs that may get in the way. Each time the player makes it to the water, the player's score is increased by 1 and the player is moved back to the grass. However, if the player is hit by a bug then the player's score is set back to 0. 

  There is no score cap so go crazy and try to get your score as high as possible.
